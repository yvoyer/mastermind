# Mastermind Game Rules

## OBJECT OF THE GAME
The object of MASTERMIND (r) is to guess a secret code consisting of a series of 4
colored pegs. Each guest results in feedback narrowing down the possibilities of the
code. The winner is the player who solves his opponent's secret code with fewer
guesses.

## CONTENTS
De-Coding board: featuring built in storage area for pegs, built in scoring table, and
hinged shield to conceal secret code.
Code Pegs: Approximately 72 large round-headed pegs (about 12 each of 6 colors).
Key Pegs: Approximately 30 small flat-headed pegs (about 15 each of black and while).

## TO BEGIN
Separate the Code Pegs from the Key Pegs. Decide which player is to be the
Codemaker and which to be the Codebreaker. Position the board between the 2 players
so that the 4 shielded holes for the secret code face the Codemaker.
GAME NO. 1 (1,296 permutations)
The play of the game goes as follows:
1) One player, known as the Codemaker, secretly places the 4 Code Pegs in the 4
holes, which are then covered by flipping over the plastic shield to conceal them from
the opponent's sight. The Codemaker can use any combination of the 6 colors he
chooses. He can also use 2 or more Code Pegs of the same color if he wishes.
2) The other player, known as the Codebreaker, sits opposite the Codemaker and
places Code Pegs in the 1st row of the Code Peg holes (closest to him). The
Codebreaker is attempting to duplicate the exact colors and positions of the secret
code.
3) The Codemaker responds by placing 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 Key Pegs in the Key Peg holes
on the 1st row as follows:
(b) A black Key Peg to indicate a Code Peg of the right color and in the right position
(without indication of which Code Peg it corresponds to).
(b) A white Key Peg to indicate a Code Peg of the right color but in the wrong position.
(b) No Key Peg to indicate a wrong color that does not appear in the secret code.
.
There is nothing about the placement of the Key Pegs to indicate which particular Code
Pegs are meant. It is part of the challenge of the game for the Codebreaker to figure out
which Code Pegs correspond to particular Key Pegs. The response when 2 pegs of the
same color appear in the secret code and/or in the Codebreaker's row can cause some
confusion. The basic principles are that one Key Peg corresponds to one Code Peg
and, that black Key Peg takes precedence over a white one (see EXAMPLE B). Study
the examples below.
4) The Codebreaker places another set of Code Pegs in the 2nd row and the
Codemaker places the Key Pegs in the 2nd row as appropriate. They pegs played in
each row are left in position until the secret code is broken.
5) The Codebreaker keeps placing rows of Code Pegs and getting feedback from the
Codemaker until he guesses the code exactly. At this point the Codemaker places 4
black Key Pegs and reveals his secret code.
6) If all 10 rows are used and the Code has not been broken, the game is over and the
Codemaker is awarded 11 points (10 points + 1 bonus point). The players then switch
roles.
7) Provided he has given correct information, the Codemaker gets 1 point for each row
of pegs played by the Codebreaker. The players then switch roles for the next game.
however, if the Codebreaker can show that the Codemaker has given wrong
information, the game is replayed and 3 extra points are given to the Codebreaker.
8) Play continues for a series of games, the number being determined in advance. The
winner is the player with the most points in the series.

## GAME NO. 2 (2,401 permutations)
The sequence of play is exactly the same as in Game No. 1, but the codemaker may
leave 1or more Code Peg holes vacant, making the number of Code Pegs used in the
game equivalent to 7. Think of a vacant hole as being another Code Peg color.

## TO SCORE A SERIES OF GAMES
One player takes a white Key Peg for scoring, the other player takes black. The
Codemaker inserts his score peg at the start of each score line and moves his score
peg along his score line for each row of Code Pegs place by the Codebreaker. Scoring
is continuous throughout the series of games. Highest score wins.
That's all there really is to MASTERMIND (r).
The only suggestions we have to make is that if the Codebreaker continually takes too
long a time at his turn, a time limit of 3 or 4 minutes per turn be set. Have Fun!

## EXAMPLES

CODE PEGS:
RD = Red
BU = Blue
YW = Yellow
GN = Green
WH = White
BK = Black
KEY PEGS:
WH = White
BK = Black

### EXAMPLE A

* Codemaker's code:     RD, WH, BU, GN
* Codebreaker's guess:  WH, YW, BU, BK
* Codemaker's response: WH, BK

The response WH BK at the right indicates 1 right color in the right place BU, 1 right
color in the wrong place WH, and 2 wrong colors. The Key Pegs do not indicate which
colors are which.

### EXAMPLE B

* Codemaker's code:     RD, BU, GN, BK
* Codebreaker's guess:  WH, YW, GN, GN
* Codemaker's response: BK

The response shows 1 right color in the right place GN. Note that the Codemaker plays
only one Key Peg even though 2 green Code Pegs were played, because he has only 1
green Code Peg in his secret code. Note also that he plays a black Key Peg in
preference to a white Key Peg.

### EXAMPLE C

* Codemaker's code:     YW, BU, YW, BK
* Codebreaker's guess:  RD, YW, GN, WH
* Codemaker's response: WH

Just 1 white Key Peg is played YW

### EXAMPLE D

* Codemaker's code:     RD, BU, RD, YW
* Codebreaker's guess:  GN, RD, RD, WH
* Codemaker's response: WH, BK

The 2 Key Pegs WH BK are for the 2 red Code Pegs corresponding to the 2 red Code
Pegs in the secret code.
